- Update Cargo.toml to add dependencies for numerical computation and visualization
- Add advanced features like:
    - Temperature-dependent effects
    - External rotation or flow fields
    - Vortex reconnection detection and handling
    - Self-consistent thermal excitation interactions
- Add visualization capabilities with .h5 silos or .vtk file output
- Vortex Stretching: As vortex lines evolve, they can stretch, requiring re-meshing of points
- Kelvin Waves: Helical perturbations along vortex lines, important for energy dissipation
- External Flow Fields: Add capability to impose external velocity fields
- Temperature-Dependent Effects: More sophisticated mutual friction models
- Quantum Turbulence: Seed multiple vortices to observe tangle formation
- More sophisticated reconnection algorithm: The current one is basic; a proper one would change the connectivity of lines
- External flow field: Add capability to impose external flow fields to drive the vortex dynamics
- Checkpointing: Add ability to save/resume simulations from specific timepoints
- Parameter studies: Add command-line options to vary temperature, cylinder size, etc.
- Vortex length and energy calculations: Track global quantities like total vortex line length and kinetic energy
